# DW1820A (BCM94352ZAE)
There have been a couple reports of successes with all variants of DW1820A. The *true* DW1820A with part number CN-0VW3T3 and subsystem id 1028:0021 has the most chance of success, but not 100 %. Other variants require a little more work, and again not 100 %. If you like adventures or want to save about USD 40, give it a shot.
